# Cardinal Maps

Cardinal Maps is a mapping application for Android designed to get out of your way and be there when you need it. Maps should be fast, private, and focused on what matters most—helping you navigate the world around you.

## Key Features

Every decision we make puts the user first:

- **No ads** - Clean interface without distractions
- **No tracking or analytics** - Your data stays yours
- **Online and offline modes** - Search and get directions anywhere in the world out of the box, with complete offline privacy just a few taps away.
- **Self-host your maps services** - Works seamlessly with [Headway](https://github.com/headwaymaps/headway) for those who want the convenience of online maps on their own terms.
- **Modern look and feel** - Built from the ground up with Material 3 components.
- **Smooth performance** - Using MapLibre for map rendering means Cardinal Maps is fast—much faster than you may be used if you're a FOSS maps enjoyer.
- **Transit support** - Easily view departures at nearby transit stations or plan longer journies with [Transitous](https://transitous.org/).
