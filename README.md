# Cardinal Maps

Cardinal Maps is a mapping application for Android designed to get out of your way and be there when you need it. We believe maps should be fast, private, and focused on what matters most--helping you navigate the world around you.

## User-Focused Design

Every decision we make puts the user first:
- **No ads** - Clean interface without distractions
- **No tracking** - Your location data stays private
- **Offline mode** - Navigate even when you need maximum privacy
- **Snappy performance** - Optimized for quick loading and smooth interaction
